<!--

* Motivate testing 
    - purity, types good (make some tests meaningless),
    - but still have runtime invariants that must hold
    - but we can use types to make testing easier.

* HUnit
    - familiar comfortable
    - simple example
    - not very powerful

* QuickCheck
    - simple properties
    - predicates
    - writing Arbitrary instances
    - advice on properties to look for
        - identity
        - idempotence
        - locality

* Cautions:
    - getting arbitraries right ( '\n' example)
    - can't do IO easily
    - ensuring coverage: hpc

* Summary:
    - testing is straightforward
    - can leverage types for powerful property-based testing

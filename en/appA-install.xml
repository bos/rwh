  <title>Installing GHC</title>

  <para id="x_l">We are providing the instructions below based on our
    experience installing &GHC; in mid-2007.  Installation
    instructions inevitably become dated quickly; please bear this in
    mind as you read.</para>

  <remark>We will update these instructions for GHC 6.8.2 when time
    permits.</remark>

  <para id="x_m">Because &GHC; runs on a large number of platforms,
    we've focused on a handful of the most popular.</para>

  <sect1 id="install.win">
    <title>Windows</title>

    <para id="x_n">The prebuilt binary packages of &GHC; should work
      on versions of Windows as old as ME, and on all newer versions
      (NT, 2000, XP, and Vista).  We have installed &GHC; 6.6.1 under
      Windows XP Service Pack 2; here are the steps we
      followed.</para>

    <note>
      <title>How much room does GHC need?</title>

      <para id="x_o">On Windows, &GHC; requires almost 340MB of disk
	space.</para>
    </note>
  
    <para id="x_p">Our first step is to visit the &GHC; <ulink
	url="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html">download
	page</ulink>, and follow the link to the current stable
      release.  Scroll down to the section entitled <quote>Binary
	packages</quote>, and then again to the subsection for
      Windows.  Download the installer; in our case, it's named
      <filename>ghc-6.6.1-i386-windows.exe</filename>.</para>

    </informalfigure>

    <para id="x_q">After the installer has downloaded, double-clicking
      on it starts the installation process.  This involves stepping
      through a normal Windows installer wizard.</para>

      <graphic fileref="figs/win32-wizard1.png"/>
    </informalfigure>

    <para id="x_r">Once the installer has finished, the Start Menu's
      <quote>All Programs</quote> submenu should have a &GHC; folder,
      inside of which you'll find an icon that you can use to run
      &ghci;.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Updating your search path</title>

      <para id="x_t">The &GHC; installer automatically modifies your
	user account's <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable so
	that commands like &ghc; will be present in the command
	shell's search path (i.e. you can type a &GHC; command name
	without typing its complete path).  This change will not take
	effect until you log out and back in again.</para>

  <sect1 id="install.mac">
    <title>Mac OS X</title>

    <para id="x_u">Installing &GHC; on Mac OS X takes several steps,
      as &GHC; does not yet have a standard OS X installer.  We have
      installed &GHC; 6.6.1 under Mac OS X 10.4, on an Intel-based
      MacBook.  We're not regular Mac users, and had never tried
      installing &GHC; on OS X before, and everything worked for us on
      the first try, so take heart if these instructions seem
      daunting.  The process is neither difficult nor especially
      time-consuming.</para>

    <para id="x_v">Our first step is to visit the &GHC; <ulink

      release.  Scroll down to the section entitled <quote>Binary
	packages</quote>, and then again to the subsection for Mac OS
      X.  There are four components to download, all of which are
      necessary.</para>

    <para id="x_A1">The Xcode software installer may have come bundled
      on a DVD with your Mac.  If not (or you can't find it), you can
      download it from Apple and install it.  Once you've finished
      installing Xcode, continue on to download the remaining three
      packages.</para>

    <para id="x_B1">After these downloads complete, you'll have three
      archive icons on your desktop.</para>

      hard disk icon (often named <quote>Macintosh HD</quote>).  In
      the main portion of the window, double click on
      <filename>System</filename> to open that folder, then on
      <filename>Library</filename>.  Select the
      <filename>GMP.framework</filename> and
      <filename>GNUreadline.framework</filename> folders on your
      desktop, and drag them onto the <filename>Frameworks</filename>
      folder in the Finder window that is visiting
      <filename>/System/Library</filename>.  If the Finder refuses to
      install them because you don't have permission, it will probably
      display an <quote>Authenticate</quote> button in the alert it
      displays. Click it, enter your password, and installation can
      proceed.</para>

    <para id="x_E1">With the prerequisites in place, you can turn to

      package.  From a shell, all you need to do is run

    <title>Golfing practice: association lists</title>

    <para>Web clients and servers often pass information around as a
      simple textual list of key-value pairs.</para>

    <programlisting>name=Attila+%42The+Hun%42&amp;occupation=Khan</programlisting>

    <para>The encoding is named
      <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, and it's easy to
      understand.  Each key-value pair is separated by an
      <quote><code>&amp;</code></quote> character.  Within a pair, a
      key is a series of characters, followed by an
      <quote><code>=</code></quote>, followed by a value.</para>

    <para>We can obviously represent a key as a <type>String</type>,
      but the HTTP specification is not clear about whether a key must
      be followed by a value.  We can capture this ambiguity by
      representing a value as a <type>Maybe String</type>.  If we use
      <code>Nothing</code> for a value, then there was no value
      present.  If we wrap a string in <code>Just</code>, then there
      was a value.  Using <type>Maybe</type> lets us distinguish
      between <quote>no value</quote> and <quote>empty
	value</quote>.</para>

    <para>Haskell programmers use the name <emphasis>association
	list</emphasis> for the type <type>[(a, b)]</type>, where we
      can think of each element as an association between a key and a
      value.  The name originates in the Lisp community, where it's
      usually abbreviated as an <emphasis>alist</emphasis>.  We could
      thus represent the above string as the following Haskell
      value.</para>

    &MovieReview.hs:attila;

    <para>In <xref linkend="applicative.urlencoded"/>, we'll parse an
      <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> string, and
      represent the result as an alist of <type>[(String, Maybe
	String)]</type>.  Let's say we want to use one of these alists
      to fill out a data structure.</para>

    &MovieReview.hs:MovieReview;

    <para>We'll begin by belabouring the obvious with a naive
      function.</para>

    &MovieReview.hs:simpleReview;

    <para>It only returns a <type>MovieReview</type> if the alist
      contains all of the necessary values, and they're all non-empty
      strings.  However, the fact that it validates its inputs is its
      only merit: it suffers badly from the <quote>staircasing</quote>
      that we've learned to be wary of, and it knows the intimate
      details of the representation of an alist.</para>

    <para>Since we're now well acquainted with the <type>Maybe</type>
      monad, we can tidy up the staircasing.</para>

    &MovieReview.hs:maybeReview;

    <para>Although this is much tidier, we're still repeating
      ourselves.  We can take advantage of the fact that the
      <code>MovieReview</code> constructor acts as a normal, pure
      function by <emphasis>lifting</emphasis> it into the monad, as
      we discussed in <xref linkend="monads.liftM"/>.</para>

    &MovieReview.hs:liftedReview;
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="monadcase.ap">
    <title>Generalised lifting</title>

    <para>Although using <function>liftM3</function> tidies up our
      code, we can't use a <function>liftM</function>-family function
      to solve this sort of problem in general, because they're only
      defined up to <function>liftM5</function>.  If we had a
      constructor or pure function that took, say, ten parameters, you
      might think we'd be out of luck.</para>

    <para>Of course, our toolbox isn't yet empty.  In
      <code>Control.Monad</code>, there's a function named
      <function>ap</function> with a slightly odd type
      signature.</para>

    &ap.ghci:ap;

    <para>You might wonder who would put a single-argument pure
      function inside a monad, and why.  Recall, however, that
      <emphasis>all</emphasis> Haskell functions really take only one
      argument, and you'll begin to see how this might relate to the
      <code>MovieReview</code> constructor.</para>

    &ap.ghci:MovieReview;

    <para>We can just as easily write that type as <type>String -&gt;
	(String -&gt; (String -&gt; MovieReview))</type>.  If we use
      plain old <function>liftM</function> to lift
      <code>MovieReview</code> into the <code>Maybe</code> monad,
      we'll have a value of type <type>Maybe (String -&gt; (String
	-&gt; (String -&gt; MovieReview)))</type>.  We can now see
      that this type is suitable as an argument for
      <function>ap</function>, in which case the result type will be
      <type>Maybe (String -&gt; (String -&gt; MovieReview))</type>. We
      can pass this, in turn, to <function>ap</function>, and continue
      to chain until we end up with this definition.</para>

    &MovieReview.hs:apReview;

    <para>We can chain applications of <function>ap</function> like
      this as many times as we need to, and thereby to avoid the hard
      limit of 5 on the <function>liftM</function> family of
      functions.</para>

    <para>Another helpful way to look at <function>ap</function> is
      that it's the monadic equivalent of the familiar
      <function>($)</function> operator.  We can see this clearly when
      we compare the type signatures of the two functions.</para>

    &ap.ghci:types;

  <sect1 id="monadcase.monadplus">
    <title>Looking for alternatives</title>

    <para>Here's a simple representation of a person's phone
      numbers.</para>

    &VCard.hs:numbers;

    <para>Suppose we want to get in touch with someone to make a
      personal call.  We don't want their business number, and we'd
      prefer to use their home number (if they have one) instead of
      their mobile number, because the call will be cheaper.</para>

    &VCard.hs:personalPhone;

    <para>Of course, if we use <type>Maybe</type> as the result type,
      we can't accommodate the possibility that someone might have
      more than one number that meet our criteria.  For that, we
      switch to a list.</para>

    &VCard.hs:businessPhones;

    <para>Notice that these two functions structure their &case;
      expressions similarly: one alternative handles the case where
      the first lookup returns an empty result, while the other
      handles the non-empty case.</para>

    &vcard.ghci:simple;
    
    <para>Haskell's <code>Control.Monad</code> module defines a
      typeclass, <type>MonadPlus</type>, that lets us abstract the
      common pattern out of our &case; expressions.</para>

    &VCard.hs:MonadPlus;

    <para>The value <code>mzero</code> represents an empty result,
      while <function>mplus</function> combines two results into one.
      Here are the standard definitions of <code>mzero</code> and
      <function>mplus</function> for <type>Maybe</type> and
      lists.</para>

    &VCard.hs:instances;

    <para>We can now use <function>mplus</function> to get rid of our
      &case; expressions entirely.</para>

    &VCard.hs:caseless;

    <para>In these functions, because we know that
      <function>lookup</function> returns a value of type
      <type>Maybe</type>, and <function>filter</function> returns a
      list, it's obvious which version of <function>mplus</function>
      is going to be used in each case.</para>

    <para>What's more interesting is that we can use
      <code>mzero</code> and <function>mplus</function> to write
      functions that will be useful for <emphasis>any</emphasis>
      <type>MonadPlus</type> instance.  As an example, here's the
      standard <function>lookup</function> function, which returns a
      value of type <type>Maybe</type>.</para>

    &VCard.hs:lookup;

    <para>We can easily generalise the result type to any instance of
      <type>MonadPlus</type> as follows.</para>

    &VCard.hs:lookupM;

    <para>This lets us get either no result or one, if our result type
      is <type>Maybe</type>; all results, if our result type is a
      list; or something of appropriate for some other exotic instance
      of <type>MonadPlus</type>.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>The name mplus does not imply addition</title>

      <para>Even though the <function>mplus</function> function
	contains the text <quote>plus</quote>, you should not think of
	it as necessarily implying that we're trying to add two
	values.</para>

      <para>Depending on the monad we're working in,
	<function>mplus</function> <quote>may</quote> implement an
	operation that looks like addition.  For example,
	<function>mplus</function> in the list monad is implemented as
	the <function>(++)</function> operator.</para>

      &monadPlus.ghci:list.mplus;

      <para>However, if we switch to another monad, the obvious
	similarity to addition falls away.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Rules for working with MonadPlus</title>

      <para>Instances of the <type>MonadPlus</type> typeclass must
	follow a few  simple rules, in addition to the usual monad
	rules.</para>

      <para>An instance must <emphasis>short circuit</emphasis> if
	<code>mzero</code> appears on the left of a bind expression.
	In other words, an expression <code>mzero &gt;&gt;= f</code>
	must evaluate to the same result as <code>mzero</code>
	alone.</para>

      &MonadPlus.hs:shortcircuitLeft;

      <para>An instance must short circuit if <code>mzero</code>
	appears on the <emphasis>right</emphasis> of a sequence
	expression.</para>

      &MonadPlus.hs:shortcircuitRight;

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Failing safely with MonadPlus</title>

      <para>When we introduced the &fail; function in <xref
	  linkend="monads.class"/>, we took pains to warn against its
	use: in many monads, it's implemented as a call to &error;,
	which has disastrous consequences.</para>

      <para>The <type>MonadPlus</type> typeclass gives us a gentler
	way to fail a computation, without &fail; or &error; blowing
	up in our faces.  The rules that we introduced above allow us
	to introduce a <code>mzero</code> into our code wherever we
	need to, and computation will short circuit at that
	point.</para>

      <para>In the <code>Control.Monad</code> module, the standard
	function <function>guard</function> packages up this idea in a
	convenient form.</para>

      &MonadPlus.hs:guard;

      <para>As a simple example, here's a function that takes a number
	<varname>x</varname> and computes its value modulo some other
	number <varname>n</varname>.  If the result is zero, it
	returns <varname>x</varname>, otherwise the current monad's
	<code>mzero</code>.</para>

      &MonadPlus.hs:zeroMod;
